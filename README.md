## Localization

If you want to translate this project, **Just Do It!**

Create a Pull Request: [Localization Repo](https://github.com/TDesktop-x64/Localization).

**Here is a project [translation template](https://github.com/TDesktop-x64/Localization/blob/master/en.json).**

You can find a language ID on Telegram's log.txt

For example: `[2022.04.23 10:37:45] Current Language pack ID: de, Base ID: `

Then your language translation filename is `de.json` or something like that.

***Note: Ignore base ID(base ID translation - Work in progress)***
